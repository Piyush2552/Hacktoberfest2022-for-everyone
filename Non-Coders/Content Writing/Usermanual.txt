User manuals or instruction manuals come with various products, such as consumer electronics like televisions, consoles, cellphones, kitchen appliances, and more.
The user manual serves as a complete guide on how to use the product, maintain it, clean it, and more. 
All technical manuals, including user manuals, have to be highly user-friendly.
Traditionally, user manuals have had text and diagrams to help users understand.
However, user manuals have photographs, numbered diagrams, disclaimers, flow charts, sequenced instructions, warranty information, troubleshooting guides, and contact information in recent times. 
The point of the user manual isnâ€™t to predict every possible issue or problem.
Most issues are unpredictable and are better handled by the customer support or help desk.
User manuals are there to address direct and common issues at most.
